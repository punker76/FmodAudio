    <PackageReleaseNotes>Bug Fixing Spree. A Bug of notable concern was an exception being thrown from within the FmodHelpers class Type Initializer, this has been fixed.

API additions were made to FmodSystem and ChannelControl.
FmodSystem:
    The RegisterCodec() method has now been Exposed.
ChannelControl:
    An overload was added to GetOutput(), and a parameter of SetOutput() was [made optional/given a default value].

On a side note, I've noticed a lot of downloads of this library, and not one of those who have downloaded it pointed out to me that there was a problem with FmodHelpers, the above mentioned issue. C'mon guys, I want those bug reports so I can further improve my library. Don't just go back to the last known working release, contact me about your issues...

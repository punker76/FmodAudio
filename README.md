# FmodAudio

Welcome to FmodAudio, a C# Wrapper for the FMOD audio library.

This wrapper was written for .NET Core 2.1 and above.

In its current state, it is usable. The Dsp namespace however, is incomplete, and so is the Examples section.

This wrapper is now downloadable as a nuget package. https://www.nuget.org/packages/FmodAudio

In order to use this wrapper, you will need to download the fmod native binaries from https://www.fmod.com/download
